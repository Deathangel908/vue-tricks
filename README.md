Advantages over reactjs:
 - Cleaner code (separetion between logic and view)
 - Code is intuitive
 - Handling state in react could be really a pain in the ass: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46185343/react-rerenders-whole-component-when-its-properties-change
 - Vue automatically updates input state, no need to overhead code with "<input onChange" to apply changes from input.
 - wtf is that reactjs stacksize of about 110 calls for update action
 - react doesn't have single file components, and even is some not known libs support it, your favorite IDE will go crazy about it. So what, who needs SFC? Tell me that when you start importing css files to jsx and end up with coupled together css/js across different component in huge enterpice reactproject
